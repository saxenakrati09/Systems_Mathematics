Q. Compare following network parameters between “Erdös-Rènyi random network model”
and “BA preferential attachment model” Consider n=100.
(a) Characteristic path length
(b) Average Clustering Coefficient
(c) Degree Distribution

Ans. For n=100, characteristic path length of BA model was 5.4545
whereas characteristic path length for Erdosrenyi model was random for random instances.
It could be less than, almost equal or greater than what we get in BA model.
Clustering coefficient was more for BA model as compared to ErdosRenyi model.
Also degree distribution can be seen in image files of 'degree_dist...', degree distribution
is almost the same for both the models


Q. Which of these network models fit better with real-world networks? How?

Ans. Barabasi-Albert model is more close to real-world networks, because it works on preferential attachment
principle. All the real world networks such as www, internet, social networks follow the same trend.
Its clustering coefficient is higher than a random network, nodes tend to mix with nodes of higher degree.
These are scale-free networks.
